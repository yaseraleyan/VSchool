            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:

        <ul>
            <li>The Cold War</li>
            <li>The civil-rights movement.</li>
            <li>The growth of the international drug trade.</li>
